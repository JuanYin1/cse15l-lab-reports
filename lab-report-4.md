### Step3: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
* Command used: `cd lab7/`  
  * Keys pressed: `cd l<tab><enter>`  
  * Reason: go to the working directory lab7 need to use cd command, and after I type `l`, I press `<tab>` key to let computer find the name-matched folder for me, which is faster.  

* Command used: `ls`  
  * Keys pressed: `ls<enter>`   
  * Reason: I need to know the name of the file, so I need to list them out.  

* Command used: `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar: lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *. java`  
  * Keys pressed: `javac <up><up><up><up><enter>`  
  * Reason: `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar: lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *. java` command was 4 up in my search history, so I could use up arrow access it.   

* Command used: `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestListExamples`  
  * Keys pressed: `java <up><up><up><enter>`  
  * Reason: `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestListExamples` command was 3 up in my search history, so I could use up arrow access it.    

* The output:

### Step4: Edit the code file to fix the failing test  

#### Before fixing
* Command used: `nano ListExample.java`  
  * Keys pressed: `nano L<tab>java`  
  * Reason: I type `L` and press `tab` to let computer search name-matched file for me, and it gave me `ListExampe.`, so I need to add `java` to make to a complete java file.  
 
* The output:  
<img width="1343" alt="截屏2023-02-22 14 24 31" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79886525/220863890-f935d2c8-4593-4581-bdd3-52f0dd556971.png">  

After enter the nano, I found the error and fixed it:  
Since we use nano to edit the txt file, would could edit it through the terminal:
* First, find the line I want to edit  
* Second, press `<up>` or `<down>` to find the line that need to edit  
* Third, press `<left>` or `<right>` to go to the right place to edit  
* Fourth, press `<delete>` to delete the error and edit the file using keyboard


#### After fixing  
* Command used: `^o`  
  * Keys pressed: `<cntrol>o <Enter>`  
  * Reason: press control and o at the same time to save the change, then press `enter` to save the modified buffer.  

* The output:

* Command used: `^x`  
  * Keys used: `<control>x`  
  * Reason: to exit nano.

### Step5: Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed  
* Command used: `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar: lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *. java`  
  * Keys pressed: `javac <up><up><up><enter>`  
  * Reason: `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar: lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *. java` command was 3 up in my search history, so I could use up arrow access it.   
* Command used: `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestListExamples`  
  * Keys pressed: `java <up><up><enter>`  
  * Reason: `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestListExamples` command was 2 up in my search history, so I could use up arrow access it.  

* The output:

As we can see, I fixed the error.

### Step6: Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account  
* Command used: `git add ListExample.java`  
  * Keys pressed: `git add L<tab><delete>java`   
  * Reason: after typing `git add L`, I press `tab` to help me find the match file, but it shows `ListEcample.class`, so I press `delete` key to delete `class`, and added `java` since I the file I made change is `ListExample.java`.   

* Command used: `git commit -m fixError`  
  * Keys pressed: `git commit -m fixError`  
  * Reason: to commit what I've changed  

* Command used: `git push`  
  * Keys pressed: `git push`  
  * Reason: to push what I've changed, so the fixed filr will show in the website.
