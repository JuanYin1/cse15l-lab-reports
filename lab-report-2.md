### Part 1
In order to write StringServer.java, I first go to the github and download the [folder](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/wavelet) which contans Server.java and NumberServer.java, these two files gives me some hits about how to write code for StringServer.java.  
I open the folder in the vscode, and create a file names `StringServer.java`.
