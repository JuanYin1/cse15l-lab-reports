# Part 1
In order to write StringServer.java, I first go to the github and download the [folder](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/wavelet) which contans Server.java and NumberServer.java, these two files gives me some hits about how to write code for StringServer.java.  
I open the folder in the vscode, and create a file names `StringServer.java`. 
There are two classes in the StringServer file:  
`Handler` and `StringServer`   
Steps to write my code:
* copy the code inside the main method of the NumberServer.java
* rewrite the code inside the Handler class.

**Explain the setup:**   
The code inside the main method of `NumberServer.java` is the setup part, which is going to read the port of our URL, and create a URL for us. So basiclly we do not need to change it.  
And for the `Handler` class part, we must override the `handleRequest` method because Handler class implements `URLHandler`. Also, we could not change the method header of the method. That's why I need to convert ArrayList to String before return.  
This is my code:

<sub>you could also find it from my [github](https://github.com/JuanYin1/CSE15L-lab2/blob/master/NumberServer.java)</sub>.

### What I did in my terminal:
```
javac Server.java StringServer.java
java StringServer 6677
```  

---


### What I did in my url: 
```diff
+ Valid input 1  

https://localhost:6655/add-message?s=first input
https://localhost:6655/add-message?s=second input
https://localhost:6655/add-message?s=third input
https://localhost:6655/
```
the output:

# Part 2

- My code setup:  
<img width="774" alt="截屏2023-01-25 22 20 11" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79886525/214770499-6665f8a9-0f29-4a93-914c-7073280c2d59.png">   

- failure-inducing input:  
<pre><code>
    assertEquals(s2, ListExamples.filter(s1, sc));
</code></pre>

- inputs that doesn’t induce a failure:  
<pre><code>
    assertEquals(s3, ListExamples.filter(s5, sc));
    assertEquals(s6, ListExamples.filter(s4, sc));
</code></pre>

- Screenshot of symptom:  
<img width="895" alt="截屏2023-01-26 14 01 46" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79886525/214960636-55757ad6-db3c-4da3-96d5-e7942997af1f.png">

- The bug:  

Before fix it:  
<pre><code>
    static List<String> filter(List<String> list, StringChecker sc) {
      List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
      for(String s: list) {
        if(sc.checkString(s)) {
          result.add(0, s);
        }
      }
      return result;
    }
</code></pre>. 

After fix it:  
<pre><code>
    static List<String> filter(List<String> list, StringChecker sc) {
      List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
      for(String s: list) {
        if(sc.checkString(s)) {
          result.add(s);
        }
      }
      return result;
    }
</code></pre>  

- Explain:  
I found that the method returns the correct element, but wrong order.  
And inside the `filter` method, it use for loop and add method to add each element which is valid.   
However, it used `add(index, element)`, which means each time it add element, it will **prepend** element to the arraylist.  
To debug, just remove the `index` part, which means change `add(index, element)` to `add(element)`.

# Part 3
### What I learned from lab2:  
* I learned how to compile and run two classes using terminal
* I learned url includes Protocal, Domain, Path and Query
* I learned how to download and update github document through `GitHub Desktop`
* I learned run the server on a remote computer by using `git clone` command



### What I learned from lab3:
* I need to create a concrete class for interface class before I pass an object of that class as a parameter into a method.
* Different operating system uses different commands to run JUnit, but both of them need `-cp` command
* I learned how to undersatnd the test result by checking the output
* I learned `@Test` is one of the annotations of JUnit, which tells JUnit that it is a test case
* When we test method, we could create some variables and using reference to avoid repetitive tests
